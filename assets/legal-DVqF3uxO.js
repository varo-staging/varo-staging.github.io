## 3. Account Set-Up

**3.1**. You may access our Services by creating an account and signing in to Varo.cloud. Currently, account access is provided through email-based one-time password (OTP) verification. We plan to support sign-in through Google and GitHub OAuth in the future. When those options become available, your use of them will also be subject to the applicable third-party provider's terms.

**3.2**. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and Login Credentials, including but not limited to the restriction of access to your computer and/or account. You are responsible for any and all activities or actions that occur under your account, whether through email OTP, OAuth sign-in, or API keys. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

**3.3**. You may not register for or use an account in a manner that impersonates another person or entity, uses another person's email address or identity without authorization, or uses contact or account information that is offensive, vulgar, or obscene, subject to our discretion.

**3.4**. Varo.cloud reserves the right to suspend or terminate Customer's or any Authorized User's access to the Services without incurring any resulting obligation or liability if: (1) required by a legal demand or order; or (2) Varo.cloud, in its discretion, determines that: (i) the Customer has breached any material term of these Terms, used the Services beyond granted rights or for a purpose not authorized under these Terms or in any manner that does not comply with any Documentation; or (ii) the Customer is, has been, or is likely to be engaged in fraudulent or unlawful activities related to the Services.

## 5. No Guarantees on Benefits or Fees

**5.1**. Varo.cloud is dedicated to delivering a positive customer experience, but we cannot assure the continuous availability of every Model that you may see on our Website or provide any guarantees regarding processing rates. We may in our sole discretion and at any time modify Fees for any part of our Services.

## 6. Third-Party Offerings

**6.1**. We may provide information about or access to Third-Party Offerings, or you may use Third-Party Offerings within the Services. You acknowledge that the Services rely on, interoperate with, or otherwise use Third-Party Offerings, including third-party Foundation Models that process your Inputs on our behalf to generate Outputs. To provide inference, we transmit Inputs to such third-party Foundation Model providers as service providers acting on our behalf. You agree to use Third-Party Offerings at your own risk and subject to the disclaimers in these Terms. These Third-Party Offerings are beyond our control, but their operation may impact, or be impacted by, the use and reliability of the Services. You acknowledge that (i) the use and availability of the Services is dependent on Third-Party Offering service providers and (ii) these Third-Party Offerings may not operate reliably or continuously, which may affect Service operation. You are responsible for complying with all Third-Party Terms and Varo.cloud is not, and will not be deemed to be, a party to any separate Third-Party Terms, all of which are exclusively between you and the applicable Third-Party Offering service provider(s).

Varo.cloud shall have no liability if any Third-Party Offering, Foundation Model, API, infrastructure service, or related functionality becomes unavailable, is suspended, restricted, modified, discontinued, or otherwise ceases to be supported by the applicable third party.

## 7. Availability and Support

**7.1**. During the Term, Varo.cloud will strive to maximize Service availability and provide support, but Customers acknowledge that continuous updates may cause occasional technical issues or downtime.

If an Authorized User suspects their Login Credential is compromised or may be compromised, they must promptly secure their account (for example, by signing out of active sessions, revoking compromised API keys, or re-verifying account access through email OTP) and inform Varo.cloud at [support@varo.cloud](mailto:support@varo.cloud).

## 10. Fees and Payment

**10.1**. You will pay the usage Fees charged by Varo.cloud as described on our Website and in Section 4 above. You can view your current usage and manage your billing settings in your account.

**10.2**. To utilize the Services, Customer must purchase credits in advance as described in Section 4. Each time you use the Services (whether through the Website or through an API call), the cost for such use will be deducted from your credit balance. You are solely responsible for maintaining a sufficient credit balance to use the Services. If you do not have enough credits to cover your use of the Services, you will be required to purchase additional credits. Customer can also set up automatic credit purchases by providing a payment method and authorizing us to charge Customer for credit purchases and use of our Services, as clearly explained on our Website.

**10.3**. Varo.cloud's Fees are exclusive of taxes, which Customer must pay in full without deductions. Payments are currently processed through Stripe and may be processed through additional third-party payment processors in the future; each processor has its own terms. If an automatic credit purchase fails, a payment is declined, reversed, or charged back, or Customer otherwise fails to maintain a sufficient credit balance, Varo.cloud may suspend access to paid features of the Services until the issue is resolved and sufficient credits are available. Customer remains responsible for any fees, chargebacks, reversals, or related costs caused by Customer's payment method or authorized payment settings.

**10.4**. All amounts payable to Varo.cloud by Customer shall be paid in full without any setoff, recoupment, counterclaim, deduction, debit, or withholding for any reason.

**11.2**. Consent to Use Customer Data. Customer hereby grants Varo.cloud during the Term a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable (except as necessary to third-party Foundation Model providers and other service providers acting on Varo.cloud's behalf to provide the Services), royalty-free license to use, copy, store, transmit, modify, process, and display its Customer Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Output and associated Services under these Terms. Without limiting the foregoing, Varo.cloud will not use Customer Data to train, fine-tune, or otherwise improve any models.

**11.3**. Varo.cloud Services. As between Customer and Varo.cloud, Varo.cloud and its licensors own, and reserve all rights, title, and interest, including all Intellectual Property Rights, in and to (i) the Services, and (ii) any Resultant Data.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Varo.cloud and its licensors shall have the right to collect and analyze aggregated and anonymized information relating to the provision, use, and performance of various aspects of the Services (in whole or in part) and related systems and technologies, and Varo.cloud and its licensors will be free (during and after the term hereof) to (i) use such Resultant Data to improve and enhance the Services (in whole or in part) and for other development, diagnostic, and corrective purposes in connection with the Services (in whole or in part), and (ii) utilize any such Resultant Data for any lawful purpose consistent with Varo.cloud's Privacy Policy. For clarity, Resultant Data does not include Customer Data and Varo.cloud's use of Resultant Data does not include using Customer Data to train, fine-tune, or otherwise improve any models.

Please review our disclaimers in detail to understand the scope of your responsibility and your need to do appropriate due diligence in respect of the Services.

**13.1**. Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, Varo.cloud provides the Services "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or against hidden defects, to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

**13.2**. Varo.cloud and its licensors do not guarantee the Services will be reliable, uninterrupted, error-free, or that all errors will be corrected. Varo.cloud may modify, replace, discontinue, update, or otherwise alter any Model, Foundation Model, feature, functionality, or Service component at any time without liability, including by changing the third-party Models made available through the Services. Customer acknowledges that Outputs, performance, latency, availability, accuracy, functionality, and behavior of any Model may vary over time and may differ from previous results.

**13.3. The Parties acknowledge that the Services use Third-Party Offerings over which Varo.cloud has no control, and Varo.cloud assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. Third-Party Offerings may not be warranted by their providers, and their development or operation may infringe third-party rights or use copyrighted materials without required consent in certain jurisdictions. Varo.cloud does not represent or warrant that any Third-Party Offering or other third-party material complies with Laws. Customer is responsible for reviewing Outputs as necessary to confirm that they are not subject to third-party rights, because Models may generate content that includes copyrighted materials.**

**13.4**. The Parties further acknowledge that areas of Law which apply to the Services are evolving rapidly in various jurisdictions. Varo.cloud's compliance with Laws in one jurisdiction may not necessarily result in compliance in all jurisdictions.

**13.5**. Varo.cloud further disclaims any and all warranties arising from course of dealing or usage of trade. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from Varo.cloud or its employees or contractors, including guidance provided in the Documentation, will create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms. Varo.cloud does not monitor or police documents, Customer Data, other information entered into the Services, or Outputs generated by third-party models, and Varo.cloud is not responsible for such content or Outputs. The Services may generate content that is inappropriate, offensive, illegal in certain jurisdictions, suggestive, pornographic, lascivious, violent, graphic, related to fetishes, or not suitable for children. Varo.cloud does not condone or encourage such content creation and does not monitor content for unacceptability.

**Customer acknowledges that:**

- all Outputs generated by the Services and Third-Party Offerings through Customer's use are Customer's responsibility to manage and, as appropriate, delete, quarantine, and prevent from further distribution or dissemination;
- Outputs generated by the Services may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, offensive, biased, or otherwise unsuitable for Customer's intended purposes;
- Customer is solely responsible for evaluating, validating, and verifying all Outputs before relying on, publishing, distributing, or otherwise using such Outputs.

**Varo.cloud does not represent or warrant that any Output:**

- is eligible for copyright, patent, trademark, or any other intellectual property protection;
- does not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any third-party rights; or
- is unique or exclusive to Customer.

Similar or identical Outputs may be generated for other customers or users.

**13.6. We are not responsible for any fraud, willful misconduct, or other misuse arising from your account or the improper use of your log-in credentials. Customer is responsible for monitoring its account and protecting its Login Credentials.**

**13.7**. Varo.cloud is not liable, directly or indirectly, for any damages or Loss arising from the use of third-party content or services accessible through any such third-party offerings, websites, or services available through the Services.

**13.8**. This disclaimer does not affect any warranties that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable Law.

## 14. Suspension & Termination

**14.1**. These Terms begin when you first create an account or accept them through any action on our Website and remain effective while you use the Services, unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Section 14.

**14.2**. Termination by Varo.cloud. If you have breached any provision of these Terms, if Varo.cloud is required to do so by Law, or if it is commercially impractical for Varo.cloud to provide the Services, Varo.cloud shall at its discretion, immediately and without notice, suspend or terminate any of the Services provided to you.

**14.3. Termination by You. Subject to the provisions that survive under Section 14.5, these Terms shall not apply to you upon the earlier of termination of these Terms or deletion of Customer's account and, if Customer is an entity, deletion of each of its Authorized Users' accounts.**

**14.4**. Effect of Termination. If Services are terminated for any reason, your use rights shall cease, and you may not be able to access your account and all related information or files associated with or inside your account may be deleted. Varo.cloud will not have any liability whatsoever for any suspension or termination.

**14.5**. Notwithstanding the termination or expiration of these Terms, any provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination or expiration will continue in full force and effect after such termination or expiration until they are satisfied or by their nature expire. This includes, but is not limited to, this Section 14.5 and Sections 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, and 17 of these Terms and any other obligations that may reasonably be expected to be performed or observed after such termination or expiration.

## 15. Indemnification

**15.1**. Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Varo.cloud and its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns (each, a "Varo.cloud Indemnitee") from and against any and all Losses incurred by such Varo.cloud Indemnitee resulting from Customer's use of the Services, including any Action that relates to, arises out of, or results from:

- Customer Data, including any Inputs, Outputs, and processing of Customer Data by a Model;
- breach of Third-Party Terms;
- any other materials or information (including any documents, data, specifications, software, content, or technology) provided by or on behalf of Customer;
- allegation of facts that, if true, would constitute Customer's breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants, or obligations under these Terms;
- negligence or any more culpable act or omission (including recklessness or willful misconduct) by Customer, any Authorized User, or any third party on behalf of Customer, in connection with these Terms.

**15.2**. Customer is responsible for handling legal Actions with its own counsel at its own expense, and Varo.cloud may participate in the defense at its own expense if it chooses. Customer shall not settle any Action on any terms or in any manner that adversely affects the rights of a Varo.cloud Indemnitee without such party's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If Customer fails or refuses to assume control of the defense of such Action, Varo.cloud Indemnitees shall have the right, but no obligation, to defend against such Action, including settling such Action after giving notice to Customer, in each case in such manner and on such terms as the Varo.cloud Indemnitees may deem appropriate. The Varo.cloud Indemnitee's failure to comply with this Section 15.2 will not relieve Customer of its obligations under this Section 15, except to the extent that the Customer can demonstrate that it has been materially prejudiced by such failure.

**15.3**. If the Services are, or in Varo.cloud's opinion are likely to be, claimed to infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any third-party Intellectual Property Right, or if Customer's use of the Services is enjoined or threatened to be enjoined, Customer's sole and exclusive remedy is to stop using the Services and close its account.

## 16. Limitation of Liability

Except to the extent liability cannot be excluded under applicable Law, and otherwise to the maximum extent permitted by Law, Varo.cloud shall have no obligation to pay any compensation, indemnification, damages, penalties, costs, expenses, service credits, or other amounts to Customer or any third party arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services, and Customer's remedies are limited to discontinuing use of the Services and closing its account. The foregoing limitations apply even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose.**
Unless expressly agreed in a separate written agreement signed by Varo.cloud, Customer shall not be entitled to any service credits, refunds, rebates, compensation, or other remedies arising from any Service interruption, degradation, latency, suspension, or unavailability.

**16.3. If any exclusion or limitation in this Section 16 is held unenforceable under applicable Law, that exclusion or limitation will apply to the maximum extent permitted by Law, and the remaining exclusions and limitations will remain in effect.**

**16.4**. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, these Terms do not entitle you to any remedy from our licensors. Unless you enter into a direct agreement with them, such licensors shall have no liability to you for any direct or indirect damages.

If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Services.

**17.9**. Varo.cloud's waiver of any default or breach of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach.
